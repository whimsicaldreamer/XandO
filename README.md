#### Multiplayer Noughts and Crosses game using PHP, AJAX and jQuery
###### The game is not completed yet and so not yet ready to be played.

### Work Done:
- Creation of game room
- Joining of users to the room created using a link
- Preventing more than two users to join a particular room
- Kick out users after certain interval of inactivity
- Decide who won the game or whether it was a draw
- The winner of a particular board size is decided if the player is able to fill `n - 1` cells in a line where `n` is the grid size.  
**For ex:** If the board size is **5 X 5** then the player has to fill in **4** cells in a line (diagonally/ horizontally/ vertically).
